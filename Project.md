# Remote File System in Rust – Specification 

## 1. Overview 
This project aims to implement a remote file system client in Rust that presents a local 
mount point, mirroring the structure and contents of a file system hosted on a remote 
server. The file system should support transparent read and write access to remote files 
and directories.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a local file system interface that interacts with a remote storage backend. 
- Enable standard file operations (read, write, create, delete, etc.) on remote files as 
if they were local.
- Ensure compatibility with Linux systems. 
- Optionally support Windows and macOS with best-effort implementation. 

## 3. Functional Requirements 
#### 3.1 Core Functionality 
- Mount a virtual file system to a local path (e.g., /mnt/remote-fs)
- Display directories and files from a remote source 
- Read files from the remote server 
- Write modified files back to the remote server 
- Support creation, deletion, and renaming of files and directories 
- Maintain file attributes such as size, timestamps, and permissions (as feasible) 
- Run as a background daemon process that handles filesystem operations 
continuously 
#### 3.2 Server Interface and implementation 
- The server should offer a set RESTful API for file operations: 
  - GET /list/<path> – List directory contents 
  - GET /files/<path> – Read file contents 
  - PUT /files/<path> – Write file contents 
  - POST /mkdir/<path> – Create directory 
  - DELETE /files/<path> – Delete file or directory 
- The server can be implemented using any language or framework, but should be RESTful and stateless.


#### 3.3 Caching
- Optional local caching layer for performance 
- Configurable cache invalidation strategy (e.g., TTL or LRU) 
## 4 Non-Functional Requirements 
### 4.1 Platform Support 
- ✅ Linux – Full support using FUSE (libfuse, fuser, or async-fuse) 
- ⚪ macOS – Optional support using macFUSE (best effort, no guarantee of full stability) 
- ⚪ Windows – Optional support using WinFSP or Dokany with C bindings (lower priority) 
### 4.2 Performance 
- Support for large files (100MB+) with streaming read/write 
- Reasonable latency (<500ms for operations under normal network conditions) 
### 4.3 Startup and Shutdown 
- Graceful startup and shutdown procedures
